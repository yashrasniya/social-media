Tapkeshwar
Mahadev
Dehradun
It is situated at Garhi village (Cantonment
Area) at a distance of 5 kilometres from
Dehradun city.
Through the west of Dehradun,
flows the river Tamas or Tons. Legend
says that during the Dwaparyug, it was
surrounded by thick forests, traversed
through a deep gorge, and that on its
banks the warrior-sage Dronacharya
meditated. That is why this cavetemple is called Drona Gupha.
A remarkable feature of this cavetemple is the natural formation of two
Shivlings—including the one
Dronacharya worshipped. It has a
fascinating story.
Since Drona was poor, his wife
could not give their son Ashwathama
any milk to drink. Instead, to console
him, she told him the tale of
Upamanyu to whom Shiva appeared
and who led a very joyous, meaningful
life thereafter. The boy was so
impressed that for the next six months
he penanced standing on one leg on
the bank of the Tamas and worshipped
the lord. Pleased with his devotion,
Shiva granted him the boons of eternal
youth, immortality and great fame.
Further, he directed the young lad to
drink the nectar-like milk, which
would now flow out of a Shivling in
order to retain his youth. Folklore also
tells us that when later a priest drank
the milk it turned to water which is
what we see today.
The temple was originally called
Tapeshwar, and Tapkeshwar is a
distortion of the same. The structure is
considered one of the 'Siddha Piths',
mentioned in the Skanda Puran.

Gangeshwar
Mahadev
Vikas Nagar
Situated at a distance of 46 kilometers
from Dehradun near Dak, Pathar which
emerged as a tourist spot
here the Yamuna meets the
Tamas, 46 kms from Dehradun at a
height of 2200 feet, is a small market
place. Just 4 kms away from this centre
of activity is a place of great
tranquility: The Gangeshwar Mahadev
or Bawri Temple. Situated by the side
of natural lakes used as fishery, it
houses the idols of Shiva, Durga,
Ganesha—and a Shivling, which is an
incredible tale.
The God Indra, always fascinated by
women, asked Suryadev who is the
most beautiful of women. Surya,
sensing his intentions avoided
answering and told him to ask
Chandrama the moon god instead.
Chandrama told Indra of Ahilya, wife
of the Rishi Gautama who lived at the
confluence of the Yamuna and the
Tamas. Indra then took Chandrama
with him to the ashram where he
crowed like a rooster to deceive
Gautama into thinking it was dawn. As
the Rishi left for Haridwar for his daily
dip in the Ganga Indra assumed his
appearance and entered the ashram, but
Ahilya recognised him, flew into a
rage, and cursed him. Indra now had
penises, or lingams all over his body.
Meanwhile, Ganga had apprised
Gautama of the situation. Furious, he
returned, to second Ahilya's curse and
hit the fleeing Chandrama with his wet
towel, marking her forever. Later
Gautama felt sorry for the foolish
Indra. Later angry with Ahilya, for
some reason he turned her into a stone.
That is what she remained till Shri
Rama released her from the curse. As
for Indra, this was only a temporary
setback in his eternal quest for
beautiful women.
Mahadev later appeared to Gautama
at this spot, where it is believed that
the Ganga once flowed. This is why
the temple is known as Ganeshwar
Mahadev. Every year a fair is held
here

Mahasu Devta
Hanol
Hanol is situated on the Tiuni-Mori road.
One has to reach Chakrata, which is 92
kilometres from Dehradun and then
proceed towards Harol.

The deity of 'Mahasu'is
worshipped by people in the village of
Hanol, on the eastern bank of the
Tamas (Tons). 5000 ft above sea level,
132 kms from Dehradun, the temple of
this deity was originally constructed in
the 'Huna'architectural style, but over
the ages it acquired a mixed style.

A legend says a dreadful demon
lived here and consumed at least one
man from the nearby villages,
everyday. In one of the villages, called
Mandrath, a brahmin decided to defy
this tyrant.

He began to worship Shiva who
directed Deolari Devi, one of his
woman devotees, to help the man. She
heard his story and requested her four
sons to come to Mandrath. She also
asked the brahmin to plough his fields.
On doing this, he discovered four
Shivlings-subsequently named after
Mahasu, Pavasi, Vasik and Chalda,
Deolari Devi's four sons, whom she
sent out in search of the demon. They
surrounded him from all sides and in a
battle lasting several days the demon
was killed. The villagers rejoiced, and
Shiva was worshipped as Mahasuever
after.
Other deities are also worshipped
here in this region, which belonged to
Himachal Pradesh till the British reign.
It later became a part of U.P.'s
Uttarakhand.

Bhairav
Chowk
Uttarkashi



Uttarkashi is situated on the banks of
Ganga at a distance of 199 kilometres
from Dehra Dun. It is a prosperous town
with modern amenities and is the
Headquarters of the district of the same
name.

Uttarkashi is a small and beautiful
town, situated between tworivers:
Varuna and Ashi, whose water flow
into the Bhagirathi from either side of
the town. Elevated, at a height of 1588
metres, this little town is very similar
to Kashi and Varanasi, in that it has the
same kind of temples and ghats and
likewise, a north or 'uttar' facing river.
The major temple is the Vishwanath
Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Two
other very important temples are
located in the Chowk area. These are
the Annapurna Temple and the Bhairav
Temple. Once, it is said, there were
365 temples here. Hiuen Tsang
referred to this place as Brahma Pura,
while the Skanda Puran has recorded it
as Varunavata.

It is believed that in the second
millennium of Kaliyug, Kashi will be
submerged, and Uttarkashi will replace
it as an important religious centre
==========================================
==========================================
Vishwanath
Temple
Uttarkashi

Uttarkashi is situated at a distance of 154
kilometres from Rishikesh, on the
Rishikesh---Gangotri route. The
Viswanath Temple is the most important
and ancient holy shrine in this region

of the many temples in
Uttarkashi, the temple of Lord
Vishwanath is unrivalled in
importance. Shiva, the presiding deity
of this temple, is worshipped all day
here. Every evening, visitors are
greeted by the sound of bells, and the
chanting of mantras by pundits at the
puja.
Within the courtyard of the
Vishwanath temple, and to the front of
it, is the Shakti Temple, dedicated to
the goddess of strength. The massive
brass trident projecting from this
temple bears an inscription describing
how the Vishwanath Temple was built.
According to it, the temple was built
by King Ganeshwar, whose son Guh, a
great warrior, built the trident. 26 feet
high, this trident's base measures 8 feet
9 inches, and its top, 181/2 inches in
circumference
The town of Gopeshwar also features
a Shiva Temple and a trident with
Sanskrit inscriptions. It is much
smaller

==========================================
==========================================
Kuteti Devi
Uttarkashi

Uttarkashi is the Headquarters of the
district of the same name. It is situated at
a distance of 199 kilometres from
Dehradun on the route to Gangotri.

Located on another bank, farther
away from the town, this temple was
constructed on a very old site, but
appears to be new. Its priest, the latest
from a family of priests spanning
fourteen generations, tells an
interesting story:

The Maharaja of Kota (in Rajasthan),
lost a bag of money while on a
pilgrimage to Gangotri. Thus, unable
to meet the required expenses, he
returned to Uttarkashi where he prayed
for deliverance from his troubles at the
Vishwanath Temple, promising to
marry off his only daughter to any
suitable boy from the village, should
his bag be found.

The bag was found by the priest,
inside the temple, and with all the
money intact. The delighted Maharaja
then requested the priest to arrange a
suitable match for his daughter. In due
course, the Rajkumari was married to a
boy chosen by the priest of the
Vishwanath Temple. But she was very
unhappy because marriage would take
her away from her family deity Kuteti
Devi, whom she had always
worshipped. So husband and wife
together, prayed to the goddess to
help them. Kuteti Devi appeared in
their dreams and informed them that
she would be present in their fields, in
the shape of a stone. The Rajkumari
and her husband, discovered 3 stones
with a heavenly aroma, and the Kuteti
Devi Temple was erected on the exact
spot where these stones were found.

Wilson Cottage
Harsil
Situated at a distance of 72 kilometres
from Uttarkashi on the main highway to
Gangotri it is at an elevation of 2623
metres above sea level. This sylvan
hamlet is famous for its beauty and
delicious apples.

HLarsil is named after Vishnu (also DER
known as Hari), who is believed to
have meditated here on a stone (or
'shila'), after the descent of the Ganga.
A Lakshmi-Narayan Temple marks the
sacred spot.

The cottage known as Wilson
Cottage was built by the Englishman
Wilson in 1864 who married a local
girl from the village of Dharali, close
to Harsil. A beautiful building with an
apple orchard it was built in the Indian
style. The walls were made of
alternately placed blocks of stone and
wooden logs and set the trend for other
buildings in the area.

Wilson was known as a
philanthropie, who taught the local
people to cultivate potatoes and to
transport wood down the river.

Today potato is the region's chief
cash crop and the word 'Wilson' spells
quality. A Wilson rope, a Wilson
cottage a Wilson bridge stands for
excellence.

road. The distance is about 248 kilometres
from Rishikesh.
A number of Ashrams are located on the
other side, some of them provide accommodation for visitors.

The most sacred of all rivers is
the Ganga.

The Ganga symbolizes purity. It
washes away all sins. It is compared to
a mother goddess which presides
through all the stages of life: from birth
to death. The river is believed to have
been born out of Vishnu's big toe. It is
said to flow through the skies (like the
Milky Way).

These are but a few of the myths
about the Ganga, whose temple is
situated on the right bank of the
Bhagirathi, right in the middle of the
tiny village Gangotri, 3140 metres
above sea level, where the sun filters
through the branches of giant deodars
and conifers in a mesmeric display of
light and shade.

The Ganga legend tells us all about
King Sagar's 60,000 sons who were
reduced to ashes and about King
Bhagirath's 'tapasya'to Shiva who
appeased and brought them back to
life.

The stone slab on which Bhagirath
meditated is called the Bhagirath Shila
and it is located near the Temple of
Ganga which was built by the Gorkha
General, Amar Singh Thapa

Budha Kedar
Temple-Tehri

Buses are available from Tehri the
distance being about 62 kilometres to
Budha Kedar. The famous Masartal is
situated at a distance of II kilometres
from here.

Reaching Budha Kedar from Tehri
is quite simple. Follow the Bhilangana
river upwards, pass through Simlashu
to reach Gadolia, where the road bifurcates. Now, follow the Bal Ganga river
beyond Ganshali and Siliyara villages
and - 10 kms away will reach
Chamiala, from where Budha Kedaris
just a short distance.

This temple is situated at the
confluence of the Balkhilya and
Dharam Ganga rivers. It is believed
that Duryodhan offered 'tarpana' here.

A recent earthquake caused a crack
to appear on the walls and the temple
is now going to be renovated.

The story associated with this temple
tells us that when the Pandavas were
on the lookout for Shiva after the
Kurukhshetra battle they encountered
Rishi Balkhilya at Bhrigu Parbat. The
Rishi directed them to the site of the
confluence to meet an old man meditating there. But when the Pandavas
got there, the old man vanished and a
Shivling appeared in his place. Rishi
Balkhilya instructed the Pandavas to
embrace the Shivling in order to free
themselves from their sins. Their
impressions are stamped on this
Shivling - the biggest Shivling in
northern India.

The Pandavas offered'tarpana' at the
'prayag'and proceeded to Kedarnath.
This incident is recorded in
Kedarkhand (slokas 98 to 102)

Raghunath
Temple
Tehri	
Tehri is situated on the confluence of
Bhagirathi and Bhilangana at a distance
of 83 kilometres from Rishikesh.

Tehri is a picturesque town
located at the junction of four
important roads; leading to
Devaprayag, Uttarkashi, Srinagar and
Tilwara. The Raghunath Temple is
situated right in the heart of this
beautiful town, once the capital of
Tehri Garhwal. The town's founder,
Maharaja Sudarshan Shah built many
temples dedicated to the different gods
so that his subjects can worship
according to their preferences.

After the death of king Sudarshan
Shah a conspiracy against the elder
brother Bhavani Shah was hatched by
the other princes—Sher Singh, who
was the son of a Co-wife of Sudarshan
Shah. Sher Singh was brought to
power by uncertain means. As a result
there was a conflict among the prince
and his brothers. This issue was taken
to the British officer. Sher Singh was
taken into custody and Bhavani Shah
was installed to the throne.

For this the God fearing king had
greater faith in devotion and worship.
He felt that he could not have got the
throne back, so, he built a number of
temples in his kingdom, Raghunath
Temple is one of them which is
situated on the right of the path that
goes from Tehri market to the
confluence. This temple was
constructed in the year 1859 and there
are marble idols of Rama, Sita and
Laxmana.

Now, this holy town stands in danger
of being submerged. The proposed
Tehri Dam Project would mean that all
of Tehri and its adjoining villages will
cease to exist. Plans are being made to
relocate Tehri to the hilltops
overlooking the dam.

Shri BadrinathKedarnath
Temple
Tehri

Tehni is situated on the main highway to
Gangotrat e distance of 83 kilometres
from Rishikesh

he holy confluence of the rivers
Bhagirathi and Bhilangana Ganga is
called Ganesh Prayag. The Bhilangana
collects her water from the western
slopes of Kedarnath, and the southern
slopes of Bharat Kunte. And she
derives her name from Shiva who is
believed to have once stayed here,
forestalling foul play, disguised as a
Bhil.
On the left bank of the Bhagirathi,
on a marvellous piece of rock, stands
the famous temple of BadrinathKedamath.
The King of Garhwal held Sri
Badrinath as his 'Isht' Devta' It is said
that the king had obtained even the
siddhies (powers of miracle) from
Badrinath. So his subjects used to call
him 'Buland Badri'. On his coins the
following is inscribed "Digvijay
Sarwada Badrinath o Vijayete". It was
the conviction of Maharaja Sudarshan
Shah that he got his throne back
because of the grace of Sri Badrinath.
So after regaining his throne and on the
following summer, as soon as the
'pilgrim jatra' began, he went to Sri
Badrinath Dham as a pilgrim.

Sudharshan Shah came to throne in
1817 and for 30 years he developed
this place and built Tehri town.

Maharani Guileria, mother of
Maharaja Pratap Shah was a very pious
person. She had a virtuous mind, pure
in heart and full of devotion. She gave
birth to brave princes. Queen mother
was a very great devotee of the Ganga
and she was respected like the Gods.

Her son Kirthi Shah was then very
young. For one year from 1887 as
guardian of Kirthi Shah, his uncle
Vikram Shah, took the reins of the
state. However, he did not succeed.
Queen mother Guileria, took the reins
in her own hands in 1888.

After having acted as a Queen
mother in Tehri State for 5 years who
passed it on to her son on 17 February
1892. She herself spent her days in
worshipping and locking after the
down - trodden people, meeting their
demands from her own privy purse.

She constructed the temples of Sri
Badrinath, Raghunath, the Ganga and
Sri Kedarnath and met the cost after
having sold her ornaments and other
belongings. She constructed a number
of Dharam shalas for the benefit of the
Pilgrims and also built the two
temples-Sri Badrinath & Sri
Kedarnath.

Old Palace
Tehri

Tehri is the district Headquarters of Tehri
Garhwal situated at a distance of 83
kilometres from Rishikesh, at an elevation
of about 770 metres above sea level.

This was the old capital of Tehri
Garhwal founded by Maharaja
Sudarshan Shah. Most of the palaces
here are in ruins, only parts remaining
as testimony to those days of grandeur.

When the whole of Garhwal had
come under the reign of the Nepal, the
King of Tehri, Sudarshan Shah fled to
Dehra Dun and stayed for 14 years as
an exile. About this time the British
Army conquered Almorah, the capital
of Kumaon, on 25th April 1815. The
British decided to extend their hold
towards western Garhwal. Taking the
Mandakini and Alaknanda rivers as
natural boundaries they wanted
Riskhikesh and Devprayag under
their stay. This opportunity was seized
by Maharaj Sudarshan Shah who
joined 'the Raj' to free his kingdom
from Nepal. Because of British support
he could found his capital at Tehri on
the confluence of Bhilangana and
Bhagirathi. With consent from the
Governor General he took 'prasad'
from the Mahant of Guru Ram Rai and
Har Sewak Dass of Dehra Dun and
came to Tehri to reside with his two
queens in 1815. Tehri village was
small but picturesque with a flat
surface on its ridge. He constructed his
palace here. According to
Sri Budhiballav Dyondi the capital
Tehri was founded at 11 AM on 30th
December 1815.

Thirty small houses were at first
constructed with the help of local
masons and labourers. Later it grew
with people constructing their own
houses.

Now their houses are being shifted to
another place—New Tehri Town in
apprehension of submersion because of
the giant Tehri Dam Project.

Surya Temple
Pelethi
Tehri
This temple is situated on Tehri-Devapravag road. From Tehri there is a
place called Jannikhal which is 39
kilometres from here. One has to do
trekking for about 5 kilometres downwards
to reach the temple

The Pelethi Temple Complex
comprises an independent cluster of
temples covering the villages of
Bangarh and Bhet, not far from Nala.
The Garur Mandir of Adi Badri and the
Shiva Mandir of Binsar are also a part
of this complex although they belong
to a different genre.

But of all the temples in this
complex the largest and most
magnificent is undoubtedly the Surya
Temple which is built like a chariot
that appears to be emerging right out of
a rock. The Surya Temple has a radius
of 70 feet and is 22 feet high. The
main door, beautifully carved, has
intricately patterned flowers and the
images of Ganga-Yamuna. Also
notable are images of swans and the
grasmukh. Afrieze adorns the top of
the doorway. The'garbha griha' of this
temple has a Linga Pith similar to
those found in the temples of medieval
Gujarat.

Only three temples are recognisable
in the Pelethi Temple Complex today

Raghunath
Temple
Devaprayag

Devaprayag 74 kilometres from Rishikesh,
is the first important town on Badrinath Kedarnath route

The river Ganga begins her
journey from the confluence of the
Alakananda and the Bhagirathi, at
Devaprayag, the first major confluence
on the route to Badrinath-Kedarnath.

A number of temples dot
Devaprayag, including a Devi Temple
with a resounding bell, but the major
temple remains the Raghunath Temple,
dedicated to Rama incarnated as
Vishnu. A quaint custom of the place is
that all pujaris are conducted by
Telegu-speaking priests, descendants of
centuries-old migrants.

The temple was owned by the Raja
of Tehri and upon the Raja's death all
his personal effects were always
brought to the temple which also acted
as a repository. The dome is
believed to be made of gold. It is
shaped like a lotus. The sculptures on
the walls display both Buddhist and
southern Indian influences. The
residing deities include Raghunath,
Janaki, and Lakshmana. The priests
here are from Maharashtra,
descendants of Raja Devasharma, who
gave Devaprayag its name
==========================================
==========================================
Confluence Devaprayag

The distance from Rishikesh to
Devaprayag is approximately 74
kilometres. Situated on an elevation of
about 579 metres approximately from sea level.

From the religious point of view
Devaprayag is the second most
important confluence on the way to
Badrinath-Kedarnath after the Triveni
Sangam.

An extremely rocky area the houses
in Devaprayag are a tribute to
traditional engineering skills, while its
bridges and narrow lanes are simply
fascinating. The "pandas" of Badrinath
have always hailed from this town. For
generations they have been scholars of
Sanskrit although the knowledge of the
language is on the wane among the
younger lot. But some signs of
Scholarships still exist. This is
evidenced by the elaborate
astronomical observatory built by a
local pandit.

Devaprayag is like Gaya. Like Gaya
it is regarded holy enough for doing
'tarpanas' and offering 'pind'. Here too,
it is believed that a part of Lord
Vishnu's body lies. While Gaya claims
his feet, Devaprayag claims his navel.

A big stone on the Bhagirathi's bank
is called the Bashist Kund, after the
priest Bashist, under whose auspices
Indra performed his Yagna. The exact
spot is marked on the stone. The part
that lies on the banks of the
Alakananda is called the Brahma
Kund. Many believe that Rama
meditated at Devaprayag after slaying
Ravana

Kilkileshwar
Mahadev
Tehri

Srinagar is 60 kilometer fun Tehri, 104
kilometres frem Renesand 30
kilometres from Davaprawag. This temple
is situated 12 kilometres from Srinagar
and 8 kilometres from Kirthi Nagar on the
banks of the river Alakananda

Two thousand one hundred feet up
on the bank of the Alakananda river, is
the temple of Mahadev built 600 years
ago by a king of Tehri.

A story tells how the owner of a cow
puzzled and unhappy because his cow
never milked.

Suspicious, the man followed the
animal one day and saw to his fury that
she was offering her milk to Lord
Shiva's stone linga. The man attacked
the linga with an axe slicing off a part
of it. A piece flew right across the
river, with a shrill, weird ("kil-kil-kil")
sound in its flight. Where it fell now
stands the 'Kikileshwar' Mahadev
Temple.

The King of Garhwalused to visit
this temple daily alter bathing in the
Ganga. Scores of devotees do the same
even today
==========================================
==========================================
Guru
Gorakhnath
Srinagar

Guru's cave is situatori in the heart of
Srinagar town. Srinagar is 60 kilometres
from Tehri.

At the foot of a small mountain in
Srinagar, opposite Shankar Math, and
in the courtyard of a house, a huge
rock protrudes from the mountain
slopes. This is where Guru Gorakhnath
meditated and where he met his
disciples. A tiny unobtrusive door
(through which one has to literally
crawl) will take you inside the
rock-to the Guru's cave. An image of
him has been installed there, and the
trustees look after the place. The
prayer at this temple is conducted by
the sadhus of Gorokh Panths (followers
of Gorakhnath) of the 'Nath Sect'.

Srinagar was a town of the Gods in
ancient times. Later even
Sankaracharya who had knowledge of
Shiv Shakti felt that the worship of
Shiv Puja in this cave would be ideal.
So the place has been accepted to be
the best for sadhana. Guru Gorakhnath
did his 'tapasya' at this place and it is
said that he took 'Samadhi' in this cave.

According to Atkinson the tomb was
built in 1667 but according to the
imprint on the copper plate lying with
the Pujari, it was in 1677 that the
samadhi was renovated.
==========================================
==========================================
Shankar Math
Srinagar
This temple is situated on the banks of the
river Alakananda.

All that you see from Srinagar is
the Garhwal range with its Alakananda
bed. 104 kms from Srinagaris
Rishikesh. This is where the
'Swayamvar' of Vishvamohini took
place during the Satyayug. The name
Srinagar is believed to be derived from
a Sri Yantra, drawn on a huge slab of
stone. According to legend human lives
were sacrificed in front of the Sri
Yantra in order to please the divine
powers. In a bid to stop this cruel
practice Adi Guru Shankaracharya had
the slab thrown into the Alakananda,
where it still lies.

It was at the same spot that the Guru
first realised the amazing powers of
Lord Shiva. So the Shankar Math came
up. However, Lord Vishnu and the
Goddess Lakshmi are also held in
veneration here.

Adi Guru Shankaracharya went on to
construct the beautiful Raj Rajeshwar
Temple nearby
==========================================
==========================================
Kesho Rai
Math
Srinagar

Srinagar is at the junction of roads from
Kotdwar, Rishikesh, Tehri-Garhwal and
Badrinath. This temple is situated on the
banks of river Alakananda

A devotee of Lord Narayan form
southern India, Kesho Rai, was very
old when he began his trip to
Badrinath. After climbing 2100 feet he
was tired and decided to rest. This was
the eastern bank of the Alakananda
river in Srinagar, the capital of the
kingdom of Garhwal. While he slept
Narayan appeared to him in a dream
and told him not to proceed any farther
but to dig the surface on which he was
sleeping. Kesho Rai dugmand
discovered an image of Narayan. He
then built a temple and installed this
idol in it. The temple is 800 years old
now. A flood caused by the
Alakananda resulted in its sinking a
few inches into the ground, Repairs
were done.

==========================================
==========================================
Kamleshwar
Mahadev
Temple
Srinagar

Kameleshwar is situated in the
heart of Srinagar town. Srinagaris now one
of the biggest townships of the district and
the seat of Garhwai University,

A fier slaying Ravana Shri Ram
prayed for all the casualties of the epic
war. In Srinagar he worshipped Shiva*
with a thousand lotuses everyday.

Shiva decided to put his devotion to
the test and one day Shiva made one
lotus disappear. When Ram found a
lotus missing he made up his mind to
pluck out one of his own eyes and
offer it to the lord. Shiva was so
impressed that he appeared in person
and stopped Ram from performing this
sacrifice. This is why Sri Ram is called
'Kamalshwar' or the lotus-eyed.

On the night of Vaikunth Chaturdasi,
which normally falls in November, this
temple witnesses score of childless
couples praying for fertility. It is said
that Lord Shivasiwass answers their
prayers. The divine powers of this
temple are furthered by this story in
1894 when the waters of the Gohana
Lake rose and washed away a large
part of the city the temple remained
undamaged.

*Elsewhere Durga is the deity that Rama
worshipped with a thousand lotuses.

Kiunkaleshwar
Shiva Temple
Pauri

Pauri is the Headquarters of the district of
Pauri Garhwal and the Garhwal division. It
is situated at an elevation of 1814 metres
above sea level on the northern slopes of
Kandoliya hills, 31 kms, from Srinagar.

sunshine often bathes the entire region
giving it a soft glow.

The Kiunkaleshwar Shiva Temple is
situated on the top of a peak on the
western side of Pauri. Dedicated to
Shiva it is located 3 kms away from
the town.

A myth says it was created by
Yamraj to mark his devotion to Shiva.
Fleeing from the Tarakasur, Rakshasa
Yamraj reached the mountain Kinasha
and sought the protection of Shiva.
Pleased with his sincerity Shiva
granted him a boon. Yamraj requested
Shiva and Parvati to reside here so that
he could remain forever at their feet.
Shiva then appeared to him in the form
of Kankaleshwar. Since then the name
has been distorted through
generations—to Kinkaleshwar and
now: Kiunkaleshwar

Lakshman
Temple
Deval

Deval is on the bus route, 14 kilometres
from Pauri. One has to walk down to the
temple site. The distance is about
500 metres.

In a village called Deval, 14 kms
south of Pauri, at a height of 4000
metres is a 900 year old temple. Built
by Swami Ramanujacharya, it is a fine
example of architecture. It is also
called 'Devalaya' which means the
'abode of gods'. Because the village
was located around this temple it was
called Deval. Like the other temples of
the region this temple also is
associated with a legend.

When Ram was performing the
Ashwamedha Yagna the brahmins told
him that the Yagna would be
incomplete without the presence of his
wife. So Lakshman went to that spot
into which the virtuous Sita had
disappeared and called her to come
out. But Sita refused to accompany
him to Ayodhya from where Ram had
banished her. She told Lakshman that
soon after she returned to the womb of
Mother Earth a rock had appeared at
the point where she disappeared and he
should take that instead as a symbol of
her presence at the Yagna. The
injunction was that the rock should be
returned to its original place after the
completion of the ritual.

That is supposed to have happened
in the fields of the village Phalsari near
Deval. The rock exists and the
villagers worshipit associating it with
Sita. The temple of Lakshman is
situated at this spot for it is believed
that it is here that he asked his beloved
sister-in-law to come out.

LakshmiNarayan
Temple
Sumari

This temple is on the bus route. From
Srinagar one has to travel up to 20
kilometres to reach Sumari and then take a
brisk walk to the temple site. The group
of temples is situated in the village called
Sumari.

North East of Srinagar, 124 kms
from Rishikesh, at an elevation of 5000
feet is the Sumari Temple Complex of
Pauri-Garhwal.

The temples here belonged to the
Vaishnav under the patronage of the
Ramanuj sect and date far back to the
time of Ramanuj Swami.

They feature both LakshmiNarayan's idols as well as a Shivling.
The main temple, however, is the
Lakshmi-Narayan shrine which attracts
many devotees.

The villagers also worship the local
deities Gaura Devi and Nagarasin
Devi whose idols are seated right at
the entrance to the village—which
incidentally is also the highest point of
Sumari.

The Pujari of the place hails from
Ratnagiri. The original priest came to
spread the vaishnav culture but after
arriving in this area he established
Narayana idols along with Shiva idols
after surveying the surroundings of the
place.

Gaura Devi
Temple
Dewalgarh
*********************************
missing
********************************
Dewalgarh was the kingdom of
the King of Garhwal. Folklore claims
that during the Satyayug King
Sashibindu's son Dewal ruled here.
Dewal, who gave the place its name
used to worship Gauri Mata. However
even earlier, Baishav, son of Kubera
had worshipped Gauri Mata in the
form of Raj Rajeshwari Devi. In fact it
was Kubera who is supposed to have
received the Devi's blessings and built
this temple.

Next to the temple on a slightly
higher plane is the huge boulder called
Som-Ki-Danda. Inscriptions on this are
in Pali, the language used during the
Ramanuj Period. Beautiful carved
figures feature inside the temple and
the view of the Himalayan range from
here is simply breathtaking.
