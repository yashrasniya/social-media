TapkeshwarMahadevDehradunIt is situated at Garhi village (CantonmentArea) at a distance of 5 kilometres fromDehradun city.Through the west of Dehradun,flows the river Tamas or Tons. Legendsays that during the Dwaparyug, it wassurrounded by thick forests, traversedthrough a deep gorge, and that on itsbanks the warrior-sage Dronacharyameditated. That is why this cavetemple is called Drona Gupha.A remarkable feature of this cavetemple is the natural formation of twoShivlings—including the oneDronacharya worshipped. It has afascinating story.Since Drona was poor, his wifecould not give their son Ashwathamaany milk to drink. Instead, to consolehim, she told him the tale ofUpamanyu to whom Shiva appearedand who led a very joyous, meaningfullife thereafter. The boy was soimpressed that for the next six monthshe penanced standing on one leg onthe bank of the Tamas and worshippedthe lord. Pleased with his devotion,Shiva granted him the boons of eternalyouth, immortality and great fame.Further, he directed the young lad todrink the nectar-like milk, whichwould now flow out of a Shivling inorder to retain his youth. Folklore alsotells us that when later a priest drankthe milk it turned to water which iswhat we see today.The temple was originally calledTapeshwar, and Tapkeshwar is adistortion of the same. The structure isconsidered one of the 'Siddha Piths',mentioned in the Skanda Puran.
